# Hello World in VDM-SL

This is just a "Hello World" for VDM-SL, so I can remember the structure of VDM-SL.

## Installation

To run this you will either use the open-source IDE of [Overture tool](https://www.overturetool.org/), **or** the Visual Studio Code's extension of [VDM VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jonaskrask.vdm-vscode).

## Usage

In VSCode, when you have enabled the debugger in **.vscode**, run the following in debugger

```bash
print RunHello(s1)
```
This should return `true`.

**or**
```bash
print RunHello(s2)
```
This should return `false`.

**NOTE: You could also run Combinatorial Testing to run both commands at once which will be a whole new tab with a sign of "CT" provided by the VDM VSCode extension**

## Contributing
Pull requests to improve it are welcomed. This is intended to help me to remember the structure of VDM-SL, and hopefully helps you to know/remember the structure too.
